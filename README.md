## 🧾 Project Overview

Smart City Route Analyzer is a graph-based MST project that determines optimized route links in a smart city network using both *time* and *cost* as edge weights.

We implement and compare:

- Prim’s Algorithm (for Time & Cost)
- Kruskal’s Algorithm (for Time & Cost)

The project includes:
- empirical testing (execution-time measurement in Python)  
- theoretical comparison and final conclusion

Goal → identify which MST approach performs better for our Smart City routing use case.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Apply MST algorithms for route optimization decisions.
- Optimize using both time & cost variables separately.
- Compare Prim vs Kruskal using theory and measured execution times.
- Present observation-based result & conclusion.

## 🧠 Algorithms Used

- *Prim’s Algorithm* → used for both time and cost MST generation  
- *Kruskal’s Algorithm* → used for both time and cost MST generation

Theoretical complexities discussed in conclusion section (not shown in table format).
